My favorite TV show is The Office, and I love watching it when I can't find anything else to watch.
I have watched all **9 seasons** of the show around 15 times through, and I still love the show.
One fun fact about the show is that the lots of the intro to the show is from a trip that John Krasinski(Jim) took through Scranton, PA.
